# Overall-Phase-1-Project
# World Universities List
 ## Introduction 
  I'm required to write a program that aims to provide a user-friendly interface to browse a list of universities worldwide. Users can filter universities by name and state/province, and visit their websites directly from the interface.
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the interface to explore universities and their websites.
4. When filtering, Enter the name or state/province of the university in the corresponding input fields to filter the list dynamically. The table will update in real-time based on the entered filter criteria.
5. Click on the "Website" button corresponding to each university entry to visit the university's website in a new tab.
6. Click on the "Add University" button to be taken to the form where you can add a University to the table and to the API.
7. Click on the "To The Top" button to be taken to the top of the page.
## Implementation Details
The application fetches university data from a JSON file hosted on GitHub using the Fetch API. Upon loading, the application populates a table with university data fetched from the JSON file. Users can filter universities by name and state/province using the input fields provided.Each university entry in the table includes a "Website" button, which allows users to visit the university's website directly.The interface is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.
## Technologhies Used
1. HTML-Markup language for structuring the web page.
2. CSS-Stylesheet language for styling the web page.
3. JavaScript-Programming language for implementing dynamic functionality.
4. Fetch API-Web API used for fetching data asynchronously.
5. GitHub Pages-Hosts the JSON file containing university data.
